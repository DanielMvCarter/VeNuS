0,CVE-2011-4130,9.0,Use-after-free vulnerability in the Response API in ProFTPD before 1.3.3g allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving an error that occurs after an FTP data transfer.,http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3711
1,CVE-2019-12815,7.5,"An arbitrary file copy vulnerability in mod_copy in ProFTPD up to 1.3.5b allows for remote code execution and information disclosure without authentication, a related issue to CVE-2015-3306.",https://tbspace.de/cve201912815proftpd.html
2,CVE-2010-3867,7.1,"Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in the mod_site_misc module in ProFTPD before 1.3.3c allow remote authenticated users to create directories, delete directories, create symlinks, and modify file timestamps via directory traversal sequences in a (1) SITE MKDIR, (2) SITE RMDIR, (3) SITE SYMLINK, or (4) SITE UTIME command.",http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/44562
3,CVE-2010-4652,6.8,"Heap-based buffer overflow in the sql_prepare_where function (contrib/mod_sql.c) in ProFTPD before 1.3.3d, when mod_sql is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted username containing substitution tags, which are not properly handled during construction of an SQL query.",https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=670170
4,CVE-2009-0543,6.8,"ProFTPD Server 1.3.1, with NLS support enabled, allows remote attackers to bypass SQL injection protection mechanisms via invalid, encoded multibyte characters, which are not properly handled in (1) mod_sql_mysql and (2) mod_sql_postgres.",No Patch Identified
5,CVE-2009-3639,5.8,"The mod_tls module in ProFTPD before 1.3.2b, and 1.3.3 before 1.3.3rc2, when the dNSNameRequired TLS option is enabled, does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 client certificate, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended client-hostname restrictions via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.",https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=530719
6,CVE-2020-9272,5.0,ProFTPD 1.3.7 has an out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerability in mod_cap via the cap_text.c cap_to_text function.,https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/902
7,CVE-2019-19272,5.0,An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD before 1.3.6. Direct dereference of a NULL pointer (a variable initialized to NULL) leads to a crash when validating the certificate of a client connecting to the server in a TLS client/server mutual-authentication setup.,No Patch Identified
8,CVE-2019-19271,5.0,"An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD before 1.3.6. A wrong iteration variable, used when checking a client certificate against CRL entries (installed by a system administrator), can cause some CRL entries to be ignored, and can allow clients whose certificates have been revoked to proceed with a connection to the server.",https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/860
9,CVE-2019-19270,5.0,"An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. Failure to check for the appropriate field of a CRL entry (checking twice for subject, rather than once for subject and once for issuer) prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account, and can allow clients whose certificates have been revoked to proceed with a connection to the server.",https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/859
10,CVE-2019-18217,5.0,ProFTPD before 1.3.6b and 1.3.7rc before 1.3.7rc2 allows remote unauthenticated denial-of-service due to incorrect handling of overly long commands because main.c in a child process enters an infinite loop.,https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-940889.pdf
11,CVE-2016-3125,5.0,"The mod_tls module in ProFTPD before 1.3.5b and 1.3.6 before 1.3.6rc2 does not properly handle the TLSDHParamFile directive, which might cause a weaker than intended Diffie-Hellman (DH) key to be used and consequently allow attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors.",http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2016-March/179109.html
12,CVE-2011-1137,5.0,Integer overflow in the mod_sftp (aka SFTP) module in ProFTPD 1.3.3d and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption leading to OOM kill) via a malformed SSH message.,https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=681718
13,CVE-2008-7265,4.0,The pr_data_xfer function in ProFTPD before 1.3.2rc3 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an ABOR command during a data transfer.,http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3131
14,CVE-2017-7418,2.1,"ProFTPD before 1.3.5e and 1.3.6 before 1.3.6rc5 controls whether the home directory of a user could contain a symbolic link through the AllowChrootSymlinks configuration option, but checks only the last path component when enforcing AllowChrootSymlinks. Attackers with local access could bypass the AllowChrootSymlinks control by replacing a path component (other than the last one) with a symbolic link. The threat model includes an attacker who is not granted full filesystem access by a hosting provider, but can reconfigure the home directory of an FTP user.",https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/pull/444/commits/349addc3be4fcdad9bd4ec01ad1ccd916c898ed8
15,CVE-2012-6095,1.2,"ProFTPD before 1.3.5rc1, when using the UserOwner directive, allows local users to modify the ownership of arbitrary files via a race condition and a symlink attack on the (1) MKD or (2) XMKD commands.",No Patch Identified
